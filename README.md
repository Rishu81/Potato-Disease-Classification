## 📜 Overview
This project focuses on identifying diseases in potato plants using advanced deep learning techniques, enabling farmers to take timely action and reduce crop loss. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of potato leaves affected by various diseases to accurately classify leaf health status.

### 🔍 Why Potato Disease Detection?
Potatoes are a global staple food, but they’re highly susceptible to diseases that can drastically impact yield. By identifying diseases early, farmers can treat crops in time to improve their harvest quality and yield.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Classifies diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight, as well as healthy leaves.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily upload images to get disease classifications in real-time.
- **High Accuracy Model:** Achieved over 90% accuracy with transfer learning and data augmentation.
- **Ready for Deployment:** Suitable for web or mobile integration for on-field diagnosis.

## 📊 Model Training
We used a **CNN model** with transfer learning to improve the performance of our classification system.

- **Model:** ResNet-50
- **Dataset:** [Potato Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)
- **Training Techniques:** Data augmentation, dropout regularization, and learning rate scheduling.
